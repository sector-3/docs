## On-Chain Governance

The [`$SECTOR3`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xe5ec44dd7d49e6edf31878e55dec12eb79bd10ae) token is the Sector#3 DAO's token used for on-chain governance of the DAO's Governor smart contract.

## Governor Smart Contract

DAO contributors who hold governance tokens can interact with the DAO's Governor smart contract at  https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8087de46076212a21ea5cd8b4368bcbd826d7b32 (via the [Tally UI](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/sector-3-optimism)).

## Max Total Supply

The max total supply of the `$SECTOR3` token is 2,049. The smart contract does not allow minting of more tokens.

## Governance Proposals

The threshold for creating a new proposal is 2.049 `$SECTOR`, representing 0.1% of the total supply.

Quorum (vote participation) needed for a proposal to go through is 20.49 `$SECTOR3`, representing 1% of the total supply.

## Initial Setup

After the mint of the 2,049 token supply, we cannot deposit 100% of the supply in the DAO's governor smart contract. This is because a minimum of 1% of the total supply is needed for executing proposals.

As a temporary setup, 1% of the supply were kept by the deployer account so that we don't lock ourselves out of the Governor smart contract. Once 100 tokens have been put into circulation (for rewarding contributors), the remaining 1% held by the deployer account will be transferred to the DAO smart contract. At this point, the governance of the DAO will be fully decentralized and autonomous.

## Earning Tokens

The only way to earn `$SECTOR3` tokens is by contributing to one of the DAO's priorities: https://optimism.sector3.xyz/v1/daos/0x66440677150b7871F32961E52B4B9d3A46E3C0bC

Each priority has its own smart contract, with funding received from the DAO's Governor smart contract.

After a contributor has been rewarded with at least 2.049 `$SECTOR3` tokens, governance participation becomes possible.
