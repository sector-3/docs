# âž• Add Priority

After your DAO has been [deployed](/deploy-dao), the next step is to add a priority which aligns with the DAO's purpose.

A *priority* can be thought of as any type of project/guild/workgroup/workstream which brings the DAO closer to realizing its purpose.

:::info
There are two ways to add a new priority to a DAO:

1. Press the "Add Priority" button in the UI.
2. If the owner of the DAO is a smart contract, schedule a call to the `deployPriority()` function.
